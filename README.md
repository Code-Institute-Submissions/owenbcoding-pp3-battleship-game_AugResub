# How to play

Battle Ship game is based on the classic pen-and-paper game

In this version the player enters a row on the grid and the board is generated 

The player will have to guess where the ships are hidden on the board

Guessed ships will result in a hit indicating an X but you still have to guess the rest of the ship

The player will have about 10 turns to try to sink 5 ships

The player will win when all the ships have been sunk
